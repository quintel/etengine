module Qernel
  module NodeApi
    # Enables converting some calculated values from one unit of measure to another.
    #
    # Each method takes a single parameter, which allows you to convert the original value to one
    # in another unit. For example:
    #
    #   total_costs_per(:node)
    #   #=> 129721.8
    #
    # Costs can be calculated in the following units:
    #
    # * plant:           per typical size of a plant.
    # * mw_input:        Costs per MW capacity of input fuel (MWinput)
    # * mw_electricity:  Costs per MW electrical capacity (MWe)
    #                    Used by costs scatter plot
    # * mw_heat:         Costs per MW heat capacity (MWth)
    # * node:            How much do all the plants of a given type cost per year
    #                    Used for total cost calculations for an area.
    #                    Aliased as :node.
    # * mwh_input:       What are the costs per MWh of fuel input
    # * mwh_electricity: what are the costs per MWh of electricity the plant produces
    #                    Used by the costs scatter plot.
    # * mwh_heat:        what are the costs per MWh of heat the plant produces
    # * full_load_hour  The costs per full load hour
    #
    # Calculation methods to go from plant/year to another unit:
    #
    # * plant:           DEFAULT unit, so no conversion needed
    # * mw_input:        divide by method input_capacity
    # * mw_electricity:  divide by attribute electricity_output_capacity
    # * mw_heat:         divide by attribute heat_output_capacity
    # * node:            multiply by number_of_units, aliased as :node
    # * mwh_input:       divide by private method typical_input then
    #                    multiply by SECS_PER_HOUR
    # * mwh_electricity: divide by private method typical_electricity_output then
    #                    multiply by SECS_PER_HOUR
    # * mwh_heat:        divide by private method typical_heat_output then
    #                    multiply by SECS_PER_HOUR
    # * full_load_hours  divide by full_load_hours
