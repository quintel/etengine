    # Graph plugin which coordinates the calculation of flows in the molecule graph.
    #
    # The graph calcualtion process is:
    #
    # 1. Calculate energy graph.
    # 2. Set molecule graph demands based on (1).
    # 3. Calculate molecule graph.
    # 4. Set energy graph demands based on (2).
    # 5. Other energy graph plugins (i.e., Causality).
    # 6. Re-calculate energy graph, PRESERVING demands set in (4).
    # 7. Set molecule graph demands based on (6).
    # 8. Re-calculate molecule graph.
    #
    # The Molecules plugin is responsible for steps 2-4, 7, and 8.
    #
    # When Causality is enabled, the dataset used by the molecule graph will be snapshoted prior to
    # the first calculation, containing the result of any inputs set by end-users. The dataset will
    # be restored by Causality prior to the final calculation of the molecule graph; therefore there
    # is no need for Molecules to snapshot the dataset itself.
