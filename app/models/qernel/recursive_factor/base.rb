module Qernel::RecursiveFactor::Base

  # Public: Recursively traverses the graph from "self" (this node) to
  # the parent (supplier) nodes. It does so by following its input_edges
  # according to a +strategy method+. The strategy method returns either:
  #
  #   * a 'weight' of a edge/path. When returning a weight, the
  #     recursive_factor stops for that path
  #
  #   * nil, in which case the recursion continues.
  #
  # For example:
  #
  #   #        [B] (0.4)
  #   #        /
  #   # [A] <--
  #   #        \
  #   #        [C] (0.6) <-- [D] (1.5)
  #
  #   recursive_factor(:primary_demand_factor)
  #
  #   # 1.   B.primary_demand_factor => 0.4 * 1.0
  #   # 2.1. D.primary_demand_factor => 1.0 * 1.5
  #   # 2.2. C.primary_demand_factor => 0.6 * 1.5 (1.5 is result from 2.1)
  #   #
  #   # => (0.4 * 1.0) + (0.6 * 1.5)
  #
  # strategy_method        - The method name that controls the flow.
  #
  # node_share_method - Additional method_name that gives a weight to a
  #                          node. For example, use #co2_factor to
  #                          exclude nodes that have co2 filters.
  #
  # edge                   - The edge through which we called the
  #                          recursive_factor (this is nil for the first
  #                          node; recursive_factor uses it internally).
  #

  #                          method.
