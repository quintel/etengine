module Qernel::RecursiveFactor::Base

  # Public: Recursively traverses the graph from "self" (this node) to
  # the parent (supplier) nodes. It does so by following its input_edges
  # according to a +strategy method+. The strategy method returns either:
  #
  #   * a 'weight' of a edge/path. When returning a weight, the
  #     recursive_factor stops for that path
  #
  #   * nil, in which case the recursion continues.
  #
  # For example:
  #
  #   #        [B] (0.4)
  #   #        /
  #   # [A] <--
  #   #        \
  #   #        [C] (0.6) <-- [D] (1.5)
  #
  #   recursive_factor(:primary_demand_factor)
  #
  #   # 1.   B.primary_demand_factor => 0.4 * 1.0
  #   # 2.1. D.primary_demand_factor => 1.0 * 1.5
  #   # 2.2. C.primary_demand_factor => 0.6 * 1.5 (1.5 is result from 2.1)
  #   #
  #   # => (0.4 * 1.0) + (0.6 * 1.5)

  # Public: A combination of output and loss output compensation factors.

  # Allows the adjustment of recursivelly calculated values for loss outputs, and nodes where the
  # sum of outputs exceed 1.
  #
  # This is used in `recursive_factor`, but not `recursive_factor_without_losses`.
  #
  # ### Why compensate for losses?
  #
  # When a supplier node has 200 demand, gives 100 to a consumer and loses 100, we need to
  # compensate for this loss. When calculating the primary demand on the consumer node, we want to
  # know how much energy was needed on the supplier to provide 100 to the consumer. Losses are
  # therefore _included_ in the resulting value: the supplier has 200 primary demand.
  #
  # See Base#loss_compensation_factor
  # See Base#output_efficiency_compensation_factor
  def output_compensation_factor
    fetch(:output_compensation_factor) do
      loss_compensation_factor * output_efficiency_compensation_factor
    end
  end

  # Public: The loss compensation factor is the amount by which we must multiply the demand of a
  # edge in order to account for the losses of the parent (right-hand) node.
  #
  # A factor of 0.0 means that the node is 100% loss. A factor of precisely 1.0 indicates the node
  # has zero loss, while a factor greater than one means that the node has *some* loss.
  #
  # For example:
  #
  #   loss_output_conversion = 1.0
  #   loss_compensation_factor
  #   # => 0.0
  #
  #   loss_output_conversion = 0.0
  #   loss_compensation_factor
  #   # => 1.0
  #
  #   loss_output_conversion = 0.99
  #   loss_compensation_factor
  #   # => 100.0
  #
  #   loss_output_conversion = 0.2
  #   loss_compensation_factor
  #   # => 1.25
  #
  # Returns a float.
  def loss_compensation_factor
    loss_conversion = loss_output_conversion
    loss_conversion == 1.0 ? 0.0 : (1.0 / (1.0 - loss_conversion))
  end

  # Internal: Factor which compensates for output efficiencies greater than zero.
  #
  # When the sum of non-loss outputs exceed 1.0, more energy leaves the node than enters. This is
  # typically the result of conversions being used to model output efficiency. In these situations
  # recursive_factor will return values which are too high.
  #
  # For example, imagine a supplier which outputs 60% of its input as electricity, and 60% as heat.
  #
  #                 [Supplier = 100]
  #                     /      \
  #      [Electricity = 60]  [Heat = 60]
  #
  # The primary demand of the electricity node is 50: 50 energy is needed on the supplier to produce
  # 60 electricity.
  #
  # The output efficiency compensation factor is a value which may be used in recursive factor
  # calculations to fix this error. In this example, the factor will be 0.833... the number which
  # 60 must be multiplied by to get the correct value of 50.
  #
  # When the sum of non-loss outputs is less than one, no compensation is needed and this method
  # always returns 1.0.
