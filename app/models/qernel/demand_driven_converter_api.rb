module Qernel
  # Provides a slightly different ConverterApi which calculates the full load
  # period as a function of demand, instead of based on the number of units.
  #
  # ConverterApi assumes that, as demand changes, the number of units changes
  # to compensate. But in some cases this is nonsensical; for example, if
  # housing insulation is improved, it makes no sense for the reduced demand
  # to manifest in fewer heating appliances. Instead, it is likely that the
  # same number of appliances will exist, but that they will be used less
  # often.

    # Demand-driven converters have a semi-fixed number of units which changes
    # directly based on user input.
    #
    # In order to determine the number of units, we first find out what share
    # of demand is satisfied in the demanding converter by this converter. For
    # example, if the sum of output share links is 0.2, it is assumed that
    # this converter accounts for 20% of the "technology share".
    #
    # Finally, the number of units is adjusted according to how many
    # households are supplied with heat. For example, if 50% of households are
    # supplied with energy from the converter, but each unit provides energy
    # for 100 homes, the number_of_units will equal 50% of number_of_residences
    # divided by 100.
