class Qernel::ConverterApi

  # For the following attributes and methods we want to have a method that
  # returns the cost for a given unit.
  #
  # Example:
  #   total_costs_per(:converter)
  #   => 129721.8
  #
  # @param [symbol] The unit to convert the cost parameter in.
  # Allowed: :plant, :converter, :mw_input, :mw_electricity,
  # :mw_heat, :mwh_input, :mwh_electricity, :mwh_heat,
  # :full_load_hour
  #
  # Costs can be calculated in different units...
  # * plant:           per typical size of a plant.
  # * mw_input:        Costs per MW capacity of input fuel (MWinput)
  # * mw_electricity:  Costs per MW electrical capacity (MWe)
  #                    Used by costs scatter plot
  # * mw_heat:         Costs per MW heat capacity (MWth)
  # * converter:       How much do all the plants of a given type cost per year
  #                    Used for total cost calculations for an area
  # * mwh_input:       What are the costs per MWh of fuel input
  # * mwh_electricity: what are the costs per MWh of electricity the plant produces
  #                    Used by the costs scatter plot.
  # * mwh_heat:        what are the costs per MWh of heat the plant produces
  # * full_load_hour  The costs per full load hour
  #
  # Calculation methods to go from plant/year to another unit:
  # * plant:           DEFAULT unit, so no conversion needed
  # * mw_input:        divide by method input_capacity
  # * mw_electricity:  divide by attribute electricity_output_capacity
  # * mw_heat:         divide by attribute heat_output_capacity
  # * converter:       multiply by number_of_units
  # * mwh_input:       divide by private method typical_input then
  #                    multiply by SECS_PER_HOUR
  # * mwh_electricity: divide by private method typical_electricity_output then
  #                    multiply by SECS_PER_HOUR
  # * mwh_heat:        divide by private method typical_heat_output then
  #                    multiply by SECS_PER_HOUR
  # * full_load_hours  divide by full_load_hours
  #
  # @return [Float] the Cost per plant converted to Cost per unit as
  # specified in the parameter
