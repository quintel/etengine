module Qernel
# Interface for a Qernel::Graph object to the outside world (GQL).
# The purpose was to proxy the access to the Qernel objects, so
#  that in future it might be easier to implement the graph for
#  instance in another language (C, Java, Scala).
#
# The GraphApi also includes a couple of more complicated queries
#  that would be too cumbersome for a GQL query.
