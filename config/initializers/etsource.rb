    Your ETSource repository is out-of-date; in the most recent versions of
    ETSource, the data/ directory has been removed -- and its contents moved to
    the top-level directory -- but it still seems to be present in your local
    copy.

    Please update your clone of ETSource if you are using etsource@master; if
    you are on a different branch, you will need to merge/rebase with the master
    branch.

    Deleting the ETSource data/ directory will get this message to go away, but
    make sure you don't have any important uncommitted changes there before
    doing so.
