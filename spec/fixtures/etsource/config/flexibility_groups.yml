# This file defines the behavior of flexibility groups in the merit order.
#
# Flexibility groups combine multiple participants into one, which allows them
# to be treated as a single participant by the merit order. This is useful in
# two cases:
#
#   1. Excess electricity should be shared equally between the members of the
#      group, rather than first-come first-served.
#
#   2. The members of the group must be reordered according to their cost in
#      each hour. This is not possible for non-grouped members, as we must
#      respect the flexibility order set by their user.
#
# The config below expects the main name for a merit order ("merit_order" for
# the electricity merit order, and "heat_network", for the heat network merit
# order). Inside that hash should be the name of each group, and any custom
# configuration required.
#
#   order    - Defines how to sort the members of the group. By default,
#              members are not sorted (which is perfectly acceptable, and more
#              peformant, if using the "share" behavior). This option may be set
#              to "asc" to sort items by their marginal cost in ascending order,
#              or to "desc" to sort in descending order.
#
#              Note that many flexibility options do not have a (marginal) cost.
#              Ensure that the technologies which belong to this group have a
#              cost prior to enabling this behavior.
#
#   behavior - Sets which behavior to use for the group. The default behavior is
#              to assign energy first-come first-served. This may instead be set
#              to "share". The "share" behavior will assign energy fairly
#              between the members of the group according to the value of their
#              "excess_share" attribute
#
# Providing a custom group config incurs a performance penalty in the merit
# order calculation. If a set of flexibilty options do not need to be sorted
# relative to one another according to their cost, or have energy be assigned
# "fairly" between them, do NOT include a config for the group here.
