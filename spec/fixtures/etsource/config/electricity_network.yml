# LV network, peak load is MAX(demand_curve - supply_curve)

# Configures the electricity networks in the model, from low voltage to high
# voltage. The residual (unmet) demand from the lowest network is passed to the
# next network up, until all loads cancel out or there are no additional
# networks.
#
# * "name" is used by the "merit_order.level" attribute in those nodes which
#   participate in the Merit order
#
# * "peak" sets how ETEngine determines the peak load of the network level
#     - net:   MAX(demand_curve - supply_curve)
#     - gross: MAX(MAX(demand_curve), MAX(supply_curve))
